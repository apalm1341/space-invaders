Title: Space Invaders!
Description: Hey Again! This is the classic game of space invaders... supposidly.. :) I think it is but some of my friends don't think it is.. anywho.. this is a simple, classic, addictive game in which I'm sure you'll enjoy HOPEFULLY as much as I enjoyed coding it.. this is my very FIRST java applet that I've ever done before. I'm new to java. As a C++ programmer, java is basically the same.. to a certain extent.. I've learned more about java in 3 days then I have in 2 years with C++.. mousecontrol inserting images.. ect... but C++ still ownz *evil grin* hehe anywho... Thanks for looking at my game and I hope you enjoy and/or vote :)
